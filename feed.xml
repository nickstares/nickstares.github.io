&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m figuring out what I want to work on. I think that I might want to work on problems related to cities and Urbanism, either for a city government or an adjacent organization, but:
What kind of city should I be investing my time into understanding and improving?
Should it be a big, established city like NYC? Ecovillages? Small to medium sized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chartercitiesinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;charter cities&lt;/a&gt; in places that will be climate resilient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the framing of this question comes from my fears of civilizational collapse, but I don’t have a fleshed out model about what I should be concretely worried about, what could go wrong, how will those things impact different cities differently, etc. Should I be preparing to live in an ecovillage that’s mostly self-sustaining when needed, or can a place like NYC be prepared for future climate-related issues (not just disastrous weather events, but climate refugee intake, disruptions to supply chains, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two books I’d like to read on to help me understand this better are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Urbanism-Difficult-Future-Practical-Responses-ebook/dp/B0BF2TR2ZW&quot;&gt;Urbanism for a Difficult Future&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MegaThreats-Dangerous-Trends-Imperil-Survive/dp/031628405X&quot;&gt;Megathreats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting question to me is what levels of density can be supported by different technologies and infrastructures? If our future is solar and growing our own food, that can’t support the density of fossil fuels or nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">[This is a work in progress post orienting the reader to my research, as I make my research plan and invite feedback and direction from readers who are also interested in the same topic]</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cities and the Wealth of Nations</title><link href="/writing/2023/01/06/cities-and-the-wealth-of-nations.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cities and the Wealth of Nations" /><published>2023-01-06T13:15:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-06T13:15:00-05:00</updated><id>/writing/2023/01/06/cities-and-the-wealth-of-nations</id><content type="html" xml:base="/writing/2023/01/06/cities-and-the-wealth-of-nations.html">&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for 2023 is to write a review of this book. Reading it, I frequently thought, “Wow, this is an extremely interesting idea, I wonder what the economics establishment would say about it if confronted with it directly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intention for the review is to distill the insights of the book in a way where I can share them with other economists and see if the ideas hold up to scrutiny. I’d like to turn the claims in this book into a list of testable hypothesis and see if I can falsify them using historical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central idea of the book is that nation states are the wrong unit of analysis for economic life and we would be better off trying to understand economies through the lens of cities. In a forthcoming post I’ll examine her evidence for this argument and what kinds of insights this change in perspective might yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also talk about her preferred model for understanding development: import replacing, and how that has traditionally interacted with feedback from a local currency, but usually does not within the context of a nation state.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">One of my goals for 2023 is to write a review of this book.
